# Exercise Titles

In this exercise, you will...  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you make changes to the repo in the web browser, you need to run `git pull` to get them into the local version. We will learn more about git in the coming weeks, but for now it's better if you make edits to your repo ONLY on your computer or ONLY in the browser. Mixing and matching can cause conflicts. 

## Instructions 

1. Open you `CMPSC-100` folder in VSCode.
2. Copy the clone link for this repo by clicking the \<Code\> dropdown just above the list of files, then choose SSH and hit the double-square copy icon. Open the Terminal in VSCode with Terminal>New Terminal then enter `git clone <text you just copied>`. When repo finishes cloning, `cd` into the new directory.

```
